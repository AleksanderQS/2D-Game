# About it

World Monsters is a 2D game developed entirely in Java, crafted with the intention of enhancing my programming skills. Continuously evolving, I am committed to updating the game with new features and mechanics. Presently, the core concept revolves around survival and combat against various monsters, with each level immersing players in the cultural tapestry of a specific country, featuring indigenous creatures and folklore.
